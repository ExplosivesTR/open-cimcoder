# Open CIMcoder

This is an open source recreation of the AndyMark CIMcoder, which is prohibitively expensive for some teams to purchase.

## Instructions to use

Print the PCB and solder the components from the BOM. Mount to the CIM as you would a regular CIMcoder. Pinout is printed on the back of the board.
